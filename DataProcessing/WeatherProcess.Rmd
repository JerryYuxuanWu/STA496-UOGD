## Reading in data
```{r}
weather <- read.csv("../data/Weather/StationData230414-0928.csv")
```
## Cleaning
```{r}
# credit to Jerry Wu for some of the code here
weather <- weather[-1, ] %>% select(-Station.5ZR.Carlsbad..)

# Convert date column to date type
weather$`Date Time` <- mdy_hm(weather$Date.Time, tz = 'MST')
weather$`year` <- format(weather$`Date Time`, '%Y')

# Convert the rest to numeric
weather[2:14] <- sapply(weather[2:14],as.numeric)
sapply(weather, class)

# Rename the columns to match what openair uses
weather <- weather %>%
  rename('date' = `Date Time`, 'ws' = `Wind.Speed.S`, 'wd' = `Wind.Dir.S`,
         'nox' = `NOXppb`, 'no2' = `NO2ppb`, 'o3' = `O3`, 'no' = `NOppb`)
```

```{r}
# Saving
# Note that the variables are mostly covered in the trailer dataset, might need adjustments later
saveRDS(weather, "WeatherProcessed.rds")
```
